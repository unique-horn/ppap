Pattern Producing Network layers for keras.

Models that generate weights for neural networks using a pattern producing
network. Inspired by works on hyper networks and dynamic filtering networks.

  At present, the repository is riddled with *copypasta* and is not in the best
  of shapes, ping the contributors for any explanation or questions.
